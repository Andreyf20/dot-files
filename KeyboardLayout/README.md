# QWERTY Custom Symbols

This is my custom keyboard layout. It is based on [ThePrimeagen's DVORAK version.](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/keyboards)
For now this is a test, I'm gonna export this to Windows and test how it goes. It works pretty well on MacOS.

It is recommended to log out/restart after adding the keyboard layout.
