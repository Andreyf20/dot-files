### Classic terrible program not using .config but it is what it is

MacOS: `$ cp ./config ~/Library/Application Support/com.mitchellh.ghostty/config`
Linux: `$ cp ./config ~/.config/ghostty/config`

When updating the config file remember to wq from nvim because reloading doesn't work if the file is open.
