Fonts so i can stop losing them.

## Linux
Variables:
andrey -> username

`$ cp -r ./* ~/.local/share/fonts/ && fc-cache reload && fc-list | grep andrey`

## Rest of OSs

Install manually? At least for now.

## Notes

Probably need to update them at some point. So if they add new nerd glyphs, i'll have them.
